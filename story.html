  It's a sad fact that many people won’t ever step into art galleries and
  museums. Some are reluctant to do so because those places can be intimidating.
  Even contemporary art can have a snooty, rarefied air about it that feels cold
  and uninviting.

  Art is important because it’s part of the story we tell about ourselves; it’s
  our culture. It’s something that can be enjoyed in a spectrum of senses, from
  titillation to edification. But it’s often just not easy to “get into,” and
  that’s partly because of snobbery, but it’s also because art really is
  sophisticated and therefore demands time and effort.
